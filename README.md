RebirthItemTracker
==================

This uses the log.txt file to track item pickups in Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This is particularly useful for streamers, so their viewers can see their items, but can be used by anyone. It's easier to see what items you have on the tracker than it is on the pause screen, and it also shows you stats for the item when you pick it up.

Download it here: https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/RebirthItemTracker/releases (get the latest file that doesn't have "source code" in the name)

To use it, first extract that zip file and then run the exe inside.

It tries to read log.txt from inside c:\users\ (you) \Documents\my games\Binding of Isaac Rebirth\

If it's unable to find that file, you might need to put the tracker folder into that rebirth folder.

You can right click anywhere in the window to get an options screen.

You can mouse over items you've picked up to see their stats again, and click on them to open platinumgod.co.uk in your browser for more information about that item. (arrow keys and enter also work.)
