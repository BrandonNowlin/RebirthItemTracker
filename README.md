RebirthItemTracker
==================

This uses the log.txt file to track item pickups in Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. This is particularly useful for streamers, so their viewers can see their items, but can be used by anyone. It's easier to see what items you have on the tracker than it is on the pause screen, and it also shows you stats for the item when you pick it up.

To use it, first put the RebirthItemTracker directory in the same folder as Rebirth's "log.txt", then run the exe inside.

log.txt is usually at c:\users\ (you) \Documents\my games\Binding of Isaac Rebirth\
